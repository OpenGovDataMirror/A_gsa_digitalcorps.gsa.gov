                <p>Digital Corps Fellows are able to work remotely, in-person, or in a hybrid model subject to the needs of their placement agency. Fellows have the option of working from Washington D.C. where many agencies are headquartered. Your location will be negotiated and determined during the selection process.</p>
                <p>Fellows who are not located in Washington, D.C. should expect to travel occasionally for agency work and/or program events. All official travel costs will be covered by the program.</p>

                <p>Fellows will receive a total recruitment incentive equivalent to 50% of the GS-9 starting salary, with the payout weighted toward the first year. As an example, in 2022 with the recruitment incentive, Washington, D.C.-based Fellows will have a starting total salary above $82,000.</p>
