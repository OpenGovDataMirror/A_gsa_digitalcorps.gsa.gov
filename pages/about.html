        U.S. Digital Corps History
      </h2>
      <p class="text-left">
        The U.S. Digital Corps was launched in August 2021 by the Biden administration, in a collaboration between the
        General Services Administration (GSA), the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Personnel
        Management, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the White House Office of Science and
        Technology Policy. It is a cross&#8209;government fellowship opportunity operated by the GSA’s <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" 
          href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services">
          Technology Transformation Services</a> (TTS).
      </p>
      <p class="text-left margin-bottom-0 padding-bottom-2">
        The idea for a Digital Corps was sparked by technologists across government who identified a gap in the federal
        government’s journey towards digital success — a lack of early&#8209;career technology talent.
        TTS recognized the need for entry&#8209;level technologists to not only bring immediate innovation but also to
        serve
        as a continuing resource for government digital transformation. These technologists could complement the
        efforts already underway by technologists across government - bringing in fresh skills and perspectives as well as sustaining support over time. Internally growing the federal government technology leaders of the future.
        What started as an idea and grassroots effort evolved into the U.S. Digital Corps.
