"U.S. Digital Corps Fellows will play a key role in delivering for the American people — and they also represent the people they'll serve.

I am honored to support the U.S. Digital Corps in my role as Federal Chief Information Officer. Creating new ways to bring technology talent into the Federal Government is crucial to our efforts to protect, serve, and inspire the American people in today’s digital age." (The White House)
