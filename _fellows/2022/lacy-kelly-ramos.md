bio_short: Designer ready to enhance resources for citizens across the country 
why: "As a designer and technologist working with digital products, I’ve often felt a step (or two) removed from the impact of my work. After spending time in various roles for nonprofits and state agencies, I became more inspired by what my skill set can offer to public needs and the outcome of those efforts. It was exciting to learn about the Digital Corps and the exceptional work that many federal agencies are undertaking to enhance resources for citizens across the country and I'm excited to get started."
fun_fact: If there is a show about travel, Lacy has probably seen it. Learning about, exploring, and photographing new places is her favorite pastime.

Lacy is a first-generation college graduate with a B.F.A. in Graphic Design from Indiana University and a certificate in User Experience (UX) Design from the University of California, Berkeley. Lacy’s drive and commitment to make things better stem from her low-income childhood. This experience informed her creativity, resourcefulness, empathy and work ethic, and these characteristics continue to guide her work to improve products and services. Lacy has worked in various sectors both public and private including medical, policy, non-profit and education. As a human-centered designer and life-long learner she enjoys researching, testing, and designing digital products to best meet the needs of the end user.
