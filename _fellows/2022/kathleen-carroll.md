Kathleen applies human-centered design methodologies to problem spaces in public health with the goal of promoting health equity and community resilience. Previously, Kathleen worked for the Boston Public Health Commission's Office of Public Health Preparedness, where she designed educational modules and researched emerging technologies to promote community preparedness.
