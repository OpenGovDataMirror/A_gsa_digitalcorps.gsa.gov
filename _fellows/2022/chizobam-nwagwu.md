Chizobam is passionate about people-centered policy. Most recently, she was an Aspen Tech Policy Hub Winter Scholar (2022) working with a government partner, where she dove deep into the process of designing and creating good tech policy and civic technology to address the impactful public sector challenges. In summer 2021, she served as a Coding it Forward Civic Digital Fellow  at the Department of Health and Human Services where she co-led the redesign of Healthdata.gov by designing a user research study and protocol, facilitating workshops, and analyzing/synthesizing information gathered. As a Policy Innovation Lab Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, she worked on public interest tech projects, including an open-source data-visualization tool for tracking the environmental impact of municipal green bond capital planning projects. 

Chizobam also holds an MS in Public Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon. Previously, she was a Fulbright Researcher in Nigeria. Chizobam has been recognized as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar and Public Policy and International Affairs (PPIA) Fellow. When she's not working, you can find her biking to her local ice cream shop or growing too many tomatoes.
