bio_short: Cybersecurity specialist ready to continue serving the country with his technology skills 
why: "I was very fortunate that I was able to complete a Pathways internship with CISA. Having worked in the technology sector and also being in the military, I saw the critical need for technology specialists. I also wanted work as a civil servant again and the Digital Corps helped fill that desire while providing a great opportunity. It pairs my passion to continue serving with filling the technology gap we have in the United States."
fun_fact: Thomas is a huge Tottenham Hotspur fan.

Thomas is a serving Army Reservist, father of three, and a cybersecurity enthusiast. He served on active duty for five years with 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) as a Special Operations Team – Alpha Cryptologic Linguist team member. He is a graduate of the Defense Language Institute’s Modern Standard Arabic course and completed multiple deployments in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He separated from active duty and cross-trained as a Civil Affairs Specialist in the Army Reserves. It was shortly after that transition that he went back to school and simultaneously completed a Pathways Internship with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security. He worked as a Cyber Defense Analyst with the Detection and Adversary Pursuit branches within CISA's Threat Hunting sub-division during his internship and successfully converted after graduation. He has also worked as the Army National Guard’s G6 contractor cyber incident response team leader. When he isn’t working, he enjoys spending time with his family and trying his hand at raising backyard chickens.
