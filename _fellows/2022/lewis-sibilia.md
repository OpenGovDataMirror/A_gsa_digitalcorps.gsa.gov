Lewis worked as a technical editor and fact checker for a marketing agency, but switched careers because she wanted to use technology to enact positive change in the world. Lewis loves working with data, system design, and coming up with creative solutions to challenging puzzles. Her primary goal right now is narrowing her focus, as she's far too interested in too many paths in tech. Lewis is a nonbinary person living in Seattle with her partner and 2 magnificent cats (Muta and Ludwig). She has too many hobbies but her top three right now are sewing clothes, baking bread, and playing strategy games. -->
