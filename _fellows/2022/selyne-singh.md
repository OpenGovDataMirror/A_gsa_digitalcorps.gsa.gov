bio_short: Product manager ready to improve federal systems and technology
why: "I was inspired to become a U.S. Digital Corps Fellow after I had the opportunity to perform a one-month developmental assignment with the Navy’s Chief Data Officer through the New Leader Program. That experience allowed me to see the benefits of using data for decision making, the value of data sharing, and how both are extremely underutilized. Being a part of the Digital Corps will enable me to be a part of the future workforce that changes the way we currently do work in the federal government."
fun_fact: Selyne found her cat in a thrift shop in December 2020 and named him Blitzen.
