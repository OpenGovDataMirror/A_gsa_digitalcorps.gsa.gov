project: ["na"]
agency: ["VA"]
hometown: 
university: Bentley University
region: northeast
bio_short: Designer passionate about inclusivity and accessibility 
why: "I was inspired to work in UX after attending a career fair where a former U.S. Digital Service (USDS) team member was the keynote speaker. She presented a usability test of a veteran struggling to navigate and apply for health benefits on the VA website. The presentation was so emotionally moving that I had an epiphany and realized that was the type of UX work I wanted to do."
fun_fact: Nina loves interior design—it's all part of the user experience! How a space is designed can frame our decisions and ultimately affects our mood and behavior within the space. She has been slowly renovating her mid-century modern home over the last several years, even designing the kitchen cabinets and stone bathroom sinks herself.

After several years in hairstyling, Nina’s passion for design and psychology led her to embark on a new career in user experience design. She received a B.S in Psychology from Clark University and an Interactive Design Certificate from the Rhode Island School of Design. She also received an MS in Human Factors in Information Design from Bentley University. 

While at Bentley, Nina was part of a graduate research team to improve the wayfinding experience for court visitors in Massachusetts’ Trial Courts; Nina witnessed firsthand the struggles some of our less-privileged members of society were facing while navigating the Massachusetts courts. From that point forward, Nina’s calling to civic duty was cemented.

Nina cherishes spending time with her adult son, John, and her husband, Kevin.
