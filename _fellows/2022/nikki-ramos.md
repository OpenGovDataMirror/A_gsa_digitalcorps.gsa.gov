bio_short: Designer ready to build intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable products with impact 
why: Spending my formative years in such a juxtaposing era of technological innovation and ongoing chaos, I feel inclined to contribute constructively and pay it forward. In asking myself "What kind of impact do I want to leave?" and "How can I help?," Digital Corps was a clear answer. Beyond serving constituents nationwide, the program's avid community support and holistic growth opportunity also checked off the boxes.

Nikki is an interdisciplinary designer who integrates her interests in human thinking and social good to build digital products with meaningful impact. Prior to the U.S. Digital Corps, she has channeled this through UX/UI, web and graphic design, and branding in various non-profit, academic, and startup spaces. 

Born in the Philippines and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, her upbringing was shaped by culture and community. Her background (and current events) lead her to approach the design process through lens of information processing and accessibility. 

She's a first-gen graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied Cognitive Science and Digital Humanities in between advocating for key student populations and programs and tinkering on projects.

When she's not staring at screens, Nikki can be found petting a cat or running... late to yoga.
