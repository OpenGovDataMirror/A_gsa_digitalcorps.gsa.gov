why: "I chose to join the U.S. Digital Corps for a few key reasons. First, the program offers a chance to apply my skills and experiences to engaging, meaningful, and challenging work at the intersection of people, technology, and the public interest. Second, the program intentionally assembles a diverse cohort of fellows with various professional backgrounds and life experiences, united by a passion for civic tech. Third, the program strategically invests in the professional development and personal growth of its fellows. Ultimately, the U.S. Digital Corps presents a unique opportunity to support the U.S. Government, serve the American people, and protect our way of life."
