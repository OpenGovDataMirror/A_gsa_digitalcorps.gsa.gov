bio_short: Cybersecurity specialist ready to help develop solutions that better serve all Americans 
why: "I pursued an advanced degree as part of a career change, but I didn't want just any job once I graduated. I wanted a job that would allow me to help make a difference and provide opportunities to advance my career—exactly why the U.S. Digital Corps appealed to me. USDC allows me to put my newfound technical skills to work and help develop solutions that better serve all Americans."
fun_fact: Like a lot of people, she took up gardening during the pandemic. She believes there's something really cool about seeing the process of a tiny seedling growing into a delicious vegetable!

Olivia completed both her undergraduate and graduate degrees at the University of Cincinnati (UC). Originally employed in the nonprofit and social services sectors after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, she switched gears and soon after became the Director of Product Safety at a home décor manufacturer. In this position, Olivia obtained certificates in Consumer Product Safety Management through Saint Louis University. As a result of attending numerous industry events and conferences while in this role, she also became fascinated with the Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity. 

When the COVID-19 pandemic presented an opportunity for Olivia to return to school and study Information Technology, she was ecstatic. While completing her graduate work, Olivia was a research assistant for an National Science Foundation-funded IoT cybersecurity project and completed a co-op as an application system administrator at an insurance company. 

As a founding member of the Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) chapter at UC, Olivia is passionate about advocating for women pursuing careers in cybersecurity. When not in front of a computer screen, Olivia’s interests include gardening, kayaking, traveling, and cheering on her beloved Cincinnati Reds. Her rescue dog Jeff enjoys accompanying her on daily walks and making sure she is safe from squirrels.
